# Human Activity Recognition - ML 

This project is to the predict the class of the human activity with the data from [Groupware LES](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har). We have two separate set of data. Train data and Test data. The train data has the outcome variable class. We need to train a model with this data set to predict the class of the test dataset.

The entire project can be view directly from [this github page](https://venkadeshwarank.github.io/PML/)
